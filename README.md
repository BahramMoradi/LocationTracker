# LocationTracker
This project contains code for an Android application which I called it LocationTracker.
The application uses Google Location API and Google map for tracking user and send it to its backend through a RESTful interface.
The application has a local database and a very simple scheduler. 
## The functionality of the application
1. User can records it position
2. Application can save the obtained location in the local database.
3. Appllication sends the obtained location to a custom backend.
